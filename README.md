# Movie Rating Analysis

## Overview
The *Movie_Rating_Analysis* project explores a dataset of movie ratings, providing insights into movie popularity, viewer preferences, and potential trends across different genres, time periods, or ratings categories. The goal is to understand how certain attributes—like genre, release year, and rating—correlate with higher or lower viewer ratings, which can be useful for making data-driven recommendations or identifying potential gaps in movie offerings.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing data, normalizes columns, and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizes key aspects like average rating, distribution of ratings, and genre popularity.
- **Trend Analysis**: Examines patterns over time (e.g., changes in ratings trends over the years).
- **Genre and Rating Relationships**: Explores how different genres correlate with viewer ratings.
- **Visualization**: Uses data visualizations to showcase rating distributions, genre popularity, and other trends.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib`: For data visualization
  - `seaborn`: For enhanced visualizations

### Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-link>
    ```
2. **Install required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open the *Movie_Rating_Analysis.ipynb* file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run each cell sequentially.

### Notebook Structure
1. **Data Import and Preparation**: Loads the dataset, cleans missing data, and standardizes data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes distribution of ratings, viewer counts, and genre popularity.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Examines trends in ratings over years or specific periods.
4. **Correlations and Insights**: Highlights relationships between genre, rating, and viewer preferences.
5. **Visualization**: Generates charts and plots for clearer insights.

## Example Visualizations
- **Rating Distribution**: Visualizes how ratings are spread across the dataset.
- **Genre Popularity**: Displays which genres are most common or highly rated.
- **Rating Trends Over Time**: Analyzes if ratings for certain genres or types of movies have shifted over the years.

## Notes
- The dataset used here may require certain columns to be pre-processed.
- Ensure any necessary adjustments for dataset paths or file locations.

Explanation of Key Parts of the Analysis
Data Import and Cleaning:

The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and reading the dataset.
Missing or inconsistent values are handled, and data types are standardized to ensure smooth analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Rating Distribution: Shows the spread of movie ratings, helping to identify if most movies are rated high, low, or if there’s a balance.
Genre Analysis: Determines the popularity of different genres by analyzing their frequency in the dataset. This can reveal genre-specific trends in viewer ratings.
Trend Analysis:

This section focuses on examining how movie ratings have changed over time. For example, it may look at the average rating per year or the popularity of certain genres over time.
Such trends can offer insights into shifting viewer preferences or identify peak periods for certain genres.
Correlations and Genre Insights:

The notebook may explore correlations between rating, genre, and other factors. For instance, it could highlight if action movies tend to have higher ratings compared to drama or if ratings vary by release year.
Visualization:

Plots such as histograms, bar charts, and line graphs visually represent rating distributions, genre popularity, and time-based trends.
These visualizations make it easier to identify patterns, outliers, and other key insights.
